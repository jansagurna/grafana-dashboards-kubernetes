This visualization shows the distribution of vulnerabilities across different namespaces in your cluster. It allows you to quickly identify which namespaces have the most security issues.

## Using the Dashboard

To make the most of this dashboard:

1. Regularly review the vulnerability and misconfiguration summaries to understand your overall security posture.
2. Focus on critical and high severity issues first.
3. Use the "Top Vulnerable Images" panel to prioritize which container images to update or replace.
4. Analyze the "Vulnerabilities by Namespace" to identify which parts of your cluster need the most attention.

Remember, this dashboard is a tool to help you visualize and prioritize security issues. Always refer to the Trivy Operator's detailed reports for specific remediation steps.

## Setup

To use this dashboard, ensure you have:

1. Trivy Operator installed and running in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Prometheus configured to scrape metrics from Trivy Operator.
